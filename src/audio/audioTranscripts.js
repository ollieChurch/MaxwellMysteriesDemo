    office: [
        'The lights, the smoke, the grime … the city itself seemed alive that day, as I travelled the sidewalks to meet an old friend - Professor Foxworth. He’d telephoned me last night. Panic in his voice, something about his research and being followed. I’d agreed to meet at his office the following morning. But as I climbed the stairs I already had a bad feeling. The sort of feeling that might swallow you whole.',
        
        'The door to the Professor’s office stood wide open, his possessions turned over, and the Professor was nowhere to be seen. I was too late.',
        
        'I picked through the mess left behind by whichever underworld goons had done this. That’s when I saw it. Probably knocked under the desk and missed in their rush; it was the Professor’s journal. Something to cling to like a life raft in rough waters. What happened here?! I needed to investigate. And the Professor’s office seemed as good a place as any to start.'

    library: [
        'The temperature was hot. Sidewalks sizzled with such heat you could cook eggs. But breakfast would have to wait. I turned the corner to see The Public Library. Standing grand against the backdrop of city grime. ',
        
        'Inside the sprawling corridors and bookshelves were almost intimidating. The sound of my shoes echoed loudly on the tiled floor, earning me some stern looks, but all that melted away when I saw the dame behind the front desk. I wanted longer to talk to her, to drink in her smile, but I was here on business. She pointed me towards the Professor’s favourite study room where I hoped I would find the next breadcrumb in this trail.'

    laboratory: [
        'Tucked away in the pages of the Professor’s journal was a key for his laboratory. The intense summer heat had scorched the sky and angry thunderclouds looked ready to burst. There was no time to hang around. I caught a cab to the address.',
        
        'The laboratory was a jumble of unfinished inventions. Calculations covered every inch of chalkboard. Papers littered every surface. Half finished gadgets and metal contraptions sat on workbenches waiting to fulfil their purpose. The smell of chemicals and inspiration was strong in the air. Discovering the right research was going to be like finding a needle in a haystack.'

    fourJokers: [
        'Down a dark alleyway, so dark the light of justice barely makes a dent, sits The Four Jokers. A watering hole for some of New York’s most notorious underworld players. A gambling den, with higher stakes than the Empire State. If the Professor made a deal with the folk in here, he better hope it didn’t cost him his soul.',
        
        'There was one guy, I knew frequented the place, that might be able to help. Jack. A ruthless criminal who sometimes gave me information, provided it suited his own "business" arrangements.',

        'When I walked through the door it was Jack’s knowing smile that greeted me...',

        'Jack beckoned me over with: "Larry Maxwell. Why don’t we play a game. If you win I will tell you what you want to know."'

    lastStand: [
        'As the sun set, I sat at my office desk and emptied the scotch from my glass. I had all the Professor’s research, and yet was no closer to finding the man himself. The telephone rang. It was Jack.',
        
        'Jack spoke quickly. "Larry. Look you didn’t hear this from me. Vince’s boys have your Professor down at a warehouse in the dockyard. Be quick if you want to see him again in one piece."',
        
        'He hung up and I got my coat.'
    ],
    machine: [
        'I couldn’t help but gasp. Towering two, almost three, stories high The Machine loomed overhead like a metallic creature from a cheap talkie. In front of it, battered and bruised was the Professor. Two goons looming over him. One boasted "If you won’t tell us how it works we’ll figure it out ourselves."',
        
        'One of them starts moving the controls. Bad idea. All hell broke loose. The machine hissed & growled like a wild beast. The temperature in the warehouse got hot. Steaming hot.',
        
        'The Professor cried out "what are you doing? The machine isn’t ready. One wrong move and you could take out half of New York!" It took just one more punch to knock the Professor out cold. That’s when it happened. An explosion, an alarm, and a sound like the world was tearing itself apart.',
        
        'The mobster shouted "forget it! Let’s get out of here!" and the cowards ran off. I rushed to the Professor. But there was no bringing him round.  Stepping up to the control panel I knew it was down to me to shut this thing down.'
